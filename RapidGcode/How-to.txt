- "Klipper.js" and "MPCNC Klipper Fusion 360.cps/.mch" are the post-processor files for Fusion 360.

- "Move_PostProc_Files.py" is a simple script that moves the 3 post-processor files
   to Fusion's post library folder. (You can delete "Move_PostProc_Files.py" after running it).

- "GcodeRapidFeed.py" is the actual script that you need to run for it to change the values in the G-code.



**How to make sure it works:**

1. Download and install Python if you don't have it already. Then reboot your PC.

2. Run "Move_PostProc_Files.py". Once the 3 post-processor files are moved, you can delete "Move_PostProc_Files.py".

4. Move "GcodeRapidFeed.py" to the folder where Fusion 360 saves your G-codes after Post Processing.
   By default, it's "C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\Fusion 360\NC Programs" unless you changed it.

   DONE! If all those steps are completed, you can now use "RapidGcode.py" to fix the feedrate of travel moves.
